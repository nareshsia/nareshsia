# 👋 Hello, I'm Nareshprabhakar

## 💡 About Me

Hey da! I'm Mohammed Ibrahim — a mobile app developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience.

These days, I’m working with both **Flutter** and **Kotlin** side by side. I genuinely enjoy building apps in both — Flutter for its flexibility across platforms, and Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for that native Android power.  

I like turning ideas into clean, smooth, and user-friendly apps. Whether it's starting from scratch or jumping into an existing project, I'm always up for building something solid.  

If you’ve got an idea in mind, let’s make it real — simple, fast, and neat. 😎🚀

## 💼 What I Do

- 🔧 Build full-stack Flutter apps with clean architecture  
- 🎨 Design beautiful UIs with Jetpack Compose and Flutter widgets  
- 🔗 Integrate REST APIs, Firebase, and WebSockets (real-time trading, etc.)  
- 🛠️ Optimize performance, animations, and responsiveness  
- 🚀 Handle Play Store / App Store deployment and testing  
- 📦 Create reusable custom widget packages and app skeletons

## 🤝 Collaboration & Vision

- I'm always open to **freelance opportunities** and **collaborating on existing projects**, especially those with a clear product vision or a need for expert mobile development.  
- If you have an **idea** and need someone to **bring it to life**, I can help you turn it into a fully functional, production-ready mobile app — from concept to launch.  
- I believe in **building fast, testing smart, and delivering value** — because ideas deserve to be launched, not just discussed.
