# 👋 Hello, I'm Nareshprabhakar

## 💡 About Me

Mobile app developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience building clean, smooth, and high-performing applications.

Currently working with both **Flutter** and **Kotlin** side by side — enjoying the best of both worlds. Flutter helps deliver fast and flexible cross-platform apps, while Kotlin with Jetpack Compose brings the power of native Android.

Passionate about turning ideas into real, usable products. Whether it’s starting something from scratch or jumping into an existing project, always up for building something cool and impactful. 😎🚀

## 🤝 Collaboration & Vision

- I'm always open to **freelance opportunities** and **collaborating on existing projects**, especially those with a clear product vision or a need for expert mobile development.  
- If you have an **idea** and need someone to **bring it to life**, I can help you turn it into a fully functional, production-ready mobile app — from concept to launch.  
- I believe in **building fast, testing smart, and delivering value** — because ideas deserve to be launched, not just discussed.
